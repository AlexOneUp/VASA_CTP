The mission for our group is to analyze audio and classify emotion of our training data.

## Datasets Used

1. [RAVDESS Emotional Speech Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio)
   <br />
   <h3>Files</h3>
   <p>This portion of the RAVDESS contains 1440 files: 60 trials per actor x 24 actors = 1440. The RAVDESS contains 24 professional actors (12 female, 12 male), vocalizing two lexically-matched statements in a neutral North American accent. Speech emotions includes calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust expressions. Each expression is produced at two levels of emotional intensity (normal, strong), with an additional neutral expression.</p>
